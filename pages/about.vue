    <SubTitle>Summary</SubTitle>

    <p class="text-justify mt-4">
      My talent for technology and computers started when I was 5 years old. I have always had a passion for using
      computers and electronic boards.<br><br>

      I started when I was a child, repairing electronic parts and devices such as computers, radios, etc., and dealing
      with advanced electronic parts such as Arduino. On the other hand, I started learning Office and other programs
      and how to install Windows.<br><br>

      And after a while, I started learning graphic design and editing videos using different programs such as
      Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effect, etc. Then I provided this service on freelance sites. Then I
      started learning new things about programming, like programming desktop applications and other fields down to web
      applications. I started my journey on the web when I was 15 years old. I started learning the basics, such as
      HTML, CSS, and JS. Then I started gradually, providing services for building websites and WordPress, selling
      templates, etc., and gradually completing my learning roadmap and work so far.<br><br>

      During the learning journey, I used resources that helped me, such as Google, YouTube, various sites, and daily
      content from YouTube channels, as well as some forums, societies, and online courses. After finishing high school,
      I started studying software engineering with a Bachelor's degree and working with different organizations in the
      software industry field.<br><br>

      I'm planning to study for a master's degree in machine learning, and I aspire to have an associate professor
      degree in it and achieve international awards.
